# Revidly-Internship-Task-1


Run webpack dev server using the command ( npm run dev-server ).
Web App will be on localhost:8080


Note:
  I have used redux store without actions just for storing static demo data for clans and posts.
  The demo data for clans and posts is in the reducers folder inside the respective reducers file.
  I have created routes using react-router-dom for client side rendering, most of the links navigate to 404 not found page.
  I have used SCSS for styling.
